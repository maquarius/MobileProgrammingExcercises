# About
A repository to practice react-native exercises from both my laptop and my home pc.
Used for the moobile programming course i did in Spring 2020. During the course we learned about the basics of React Native.

## Future
I don't intend on continuing on this. It was coursework from Spring 20202 and adding to this doesn't bring any value.
